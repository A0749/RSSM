        "The Agariya tribe, listed as a Scheduled Tribe in Madhya Pradesh and holding the top rank in this category, had a recorded population of 41,243 individuals according to the 2011 census, constituting 0.057% of the state's total population. Known as 'Asur' in Bihar, this tribe is widely distributed across various districts in Madhya Pradesh, including Sheopur, Morena, Bhind, Gwalior, Datia, Shivpuri, Tikamgarh, Chhatarpur, Panna, Sagar, Damoh, Satna, Neemuch, Dewas, Dhar, Balaghat, Guna, Ashoknagar, Shahdol, Anuppur, Sidhi, Singrauli, Jhabua, Vidisha, Bhopal, Jabalpur, Shadol, Mandla, Dindori, and Sidhi. The primary residence areas for the Agariya tribe are Shadol, Mandla, Dindori, and Sidhi districts.",
        "The Agariya tribe has emerged as a distinct sub-tribe separate from the Gond tribe, with folklore narrating a dispute between two brothers from the Gond tribe, leading to the creation of this new independent tribe. The legend tells of the younger brother leaving home, building a hut in the forest, and discovering ironmaking as a livelihood. The descendants were named 'Agariya' due to their association with fire (agni).",
        "Residing in remote forested, hilly, and rural areas alongside other tribes such as Gond, Bhumiya, Baiga, Kanvar, and Uranv, the Agariya tribe constructs mud houses with thatched roofs made of grass or local thatch. Women adorn tattoos on their hands, feet, face, forehead, and chin. Men wear Pancha (small dhoti) and Agarkha (bandi), while women wear lugda. Their main food includes rice, kodo, kutki rice, page, maize bread, urad, moong, horse gram, and seasonal vegetables. Non-vegetarian items like fish, chicken, goat, deer, wild pig, and rabbit are part of their diet, and they make liquor from Mahua.",
        "The primary occupation of the Agaria tribe is ironmaking from iron ore, crafting tools like sickles, shovels, axes, hoes, plow irons, and arrowheads. They also collect tendu leaves, mahua, gulli, and wild roots from the forest. Those with agricultural land sow maize, kodo, kutki, urad, and moong. Fish is caught during the rainy season for personal use",
        "The Agaria tribe follows a patrilineal, ancestral, authoritative, and locally rooted system. Sub-castes include Patharia and Khuntiya, with Pathriya Agariyas making tools on a stone and Khutia Agariyas making tools with hot iron on an iron peg. The tribes have different matrimonial gotras, and main clans include Baghel, Dhurwa, Markam, Uika, Tekam, Sonwani, Marawi, Marai, Masram, Kaream, Nag, Tilam, Besra, etc.",
        "Rituals during pregnancy involve deliveries at home by local elderly women. After birth, a decoction of Mahua, Jamun, Tendu bark, Atigan, Popod, jaggery, etc. is given to the pregnant woman. Marriage age is considered to be 16-18 for boys and 15-17 for girls. The marriage proposal is made by the groom's side, and a ceremony is performed by elders. Widow and abandoned people are allowed to remarry.",
        "After death, the deceased is buried, and on the third day of Teej, family and relatives cut the hair of men. A funeral feast is held on the 10th day. The tribe has a traditional caste panchayat, with the head called Gautiya, settling disputes related to marriage, divorce, bride price, and immoral relations.",
        "Diversity is observed in the culture of tribes in different areas of the state, encompassing family structure, marriage customs, kinship, food, clothing, and traditions. The Agariya tribe engages in Karma dance, Padki dance, and marriage dance on various occasions, celebrating festivals like Navakhani, Dussehra, Deepawali, Holi, and Karmapuja. They believe in gods like Budhadev, Lohasur, Thakurdev, Dulhadev, Shitalamata, Baghdev, Jogni, Ghurlapat, as well as Hindu deities, and also acknowledge ghosts and witchcraft. Traditional songs like Karmageet, Dadriya, Suageet, Vivahgeet, Phaggeet, and Bhajan are integral to their cultural expressions.",

        "In terms of lifestyle, the Andh tribe builds houses at one end of the village, separate from non-tribal communities. Their dwellings are made of mud, typically consisting of two roomsâ€”one for the kitchen and the other as the main residence. The houses lack a veranda or courtyard. Thatching is done using grass or native tiles. In terms of clothing, men wear 'Dhotar' (Dhoti) Bandi or Kurta, with headgear like 'pagote' (turban) or cap.

In the non-vegetarian diet, they consume meat from fish, goat, chicken, pig, nilgai, and rabbit. Liquor made from Mahua is part of their practices, and men smoke.",
        "Traditionally engaged in agriculture, hunting, food gathering, and fishing, the Andh tribe has transitioned to occupations like labor and various jobs. Agriculture remains a significant activity, producing crops like jowar, bajra, maize, groundnut, cotton, moong, tur, urad, among others.",
        "Andh Patrivashi is a patriarchal, ancestrally local tribe with two sub-groups, Vartati and Khaltati.

Marriage age ranges from 16 to 20 for boys and 12-16 for girls. Marriages involve the exchange of cash, grains, pulses, and turmeric as bride price. Widows, widowers, and divorcees are allowed to remarry.",
        "After death, the deceased is either buried or cremated, with rituals continuing for ten days. A funeral feast is given, and the 'Punyati Tithi' anniversary is celebrated.",
        "The Andh tribe follows a traditional caste panchayat system with a chief called 'Mohatriyaan,' and decisions are made on various matters, including matrimonial disputes, bride price determination, divorce, property division, immoral relations, and inter-caste marriages.",

        "The origin of the Baiga tribe is uncertain, with scholars like Russell and Grierson suggesting they might be a distinct group related to Bhumiya or Bhuiya.

        "The Baiga people practice shifting agriculture, leading to a nomadic lifestyle. Their homes are constructed with bamboo, wood, and mud, often situated on hill slopes or near agricultural land.
