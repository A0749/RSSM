"यह जनजाति अन्य जनजातियों जैसे गोंड, भूमिया, बैगा, कंवर और उरांव के साथ घने जंगलों, पहाड़ी और ग्रामीण इलाकों में रहती है। अगारिया जनजाति के लोग मिट्टी के घर बनाते हैं जिनकी छत घास या स्थानीय तिनकों से ढकी होती है। महिलाएं अपने हाथ, पैर, चेहरा, माथा और ठुड्डी पर टैटू बनवाती हैं। पुरुष पंछा (छोटी धोती) और अगरखा (बंधी) पहनते हैं, जबकि महिलाएं लुगड़ा पहनती हैं। इनका मुख्य भोजन चावल, कोदो, कुटकी चावल, पेज, मक्के की रोटी, उड़द, मूंग, कुल्थी और मौसमी सब्जियां हैं। इनके आहार में मछली, मुर्गा, बकरी, हिरण, जंगली सुअर और खरगोश जैसे मांसाहारी पदार्थ भी शामिल हैं। महुआ से शराब बनाना भी इनकी संस्कृति का हिस्सा है। ",

"मृत्यु के बाद शव को दफनाया जाता है, और तीज के तीसरे दिन पुरुषों के बाल काटे जाते हैं। दसवें दिन शोक भोज आयोजित किया जाता है। इनकी पारंपरिक जाति पंचायत होती है, जिसका मुखिया गौतिया कहलाता है। यह पंचायत विवाह, तलाक, दहेज और अनैतिक संबंधों से जुड़े विवादों को सुलझाती है। ",

      "अंध जनजाति मुख्य रूप से महाराष्ट्र में पाई जाती है और मध्य प्रदेश की अनुसूचित जनजातियों में क्रमांक 02 पर सूचीबद्ध है। 2011 की जनगणना के अनुसार, मध्य प्रदेश में इनकी जनसंख्या केवल 137 दर्ज की गई है, जो राज्य की कुल जनसंख्या का 0.000 प्रतिशत है। इस जनजाति के मुख्य निवास क्षेत्र महाराष्ट्र के अकोला, नांदेड़, परभणी आदि जिले हैं। साथ ही, यह जनजाति मध्य प्रदेश के शिवपुरी, इंदौर, भोपाल, बैतूल, जबलपुर, सिवनी, बालाघाट और सिंगरौली जिलों में भी पाई जाती है। अंध जनजाति की उत्पत्ति का सटीक विवरण उपलब्ध नहीं है। इसके बारे में विभिन्न धारणाएँ हैं। शेरिंग ने इसे "/अंध गोंड/" बताया है, एस.एस. हसन ने इसे गोंड जनजाति की एक शाखा माना है, और किट्स ने इसे आंध्र प्रदेश से महाराष्ट्र में हुए प्रवास से जोड़ा है। ",
      "अंध जनजाति के लोग गाँव के एक छोर पर, गैर-जनजातीय समुदायों से अलग अपने घर बनाते हैं। उनके घर मिट्टी के बने होते हैं, जिनमें आमतौर पर दो कमरे होते हैं—एक रसोई के लिए और दूसरा मुख्य निवास के रूप में। इन घरों में बरामदा या आँगन नहीं होता। छत को घास या स्थानीय टाइलों से ढका जाता है। पहनावे में पुरुष "/धोतर/" (धोती), बंडी या कुर्ता पहनते हैं और सिर पर "/पगोटे/" (पगड़ी) या टोपी लगाते हैं। महिलाएँ लुगड़ा और चोली पहनती हैं। विवाहित महिलाएँ मंगलसूत्र और "/जोड़वे/" (पैर की अंगूठी) पहनती हैं। माथे, ठुड्डी और गालों पर टैटू गुदवाना आम है। ऐसा माना जाता है कि माथे पर टैटू होना स्वर्ग में स्थान प्राप्त करने के लिए आवश्यक है। ",
      "अंध जनजाति का मुख्य भोजन ज्वार की रोटी, राब, उड़द, तुअर, मूंग, बरबटी दाल, और मौसमी सब्जियाँ हैं। कभी-कभी गेहूँ की रोटी और चावल भी खाते हैं। मांसाहारी भोजन में मछली, बकरी, मुर्गा, सूअर, नीलगाय और खरगोश का मांस शामिल है। महुआ से बनी शराब का सेवन भी किया जाता है, और पुरुष धूम्रपान करते हैं। अंध जनजाति पारंपरिक रूप से कृषि, शिकार, खाद्य संग्रहण और मछली पकड़ने में संलग्न थी। अब वे मजदूरी और अन्य कार्यों में भी शामिल हो गए हैं। कृषि मुख्य गतिविधि बनी हुई है, जिसमें ज्वार, बाजरा, मक्का, मूंगफली, कपास, मूंग, तुअर, उड़द आदि फसलें उगाई जाती हैं। ",
      "अंध पितृसत्तात्मक और पारंपरिक जनजाति है। इसकी दो उप-शाखाएँ वर्ताटी और खल्टाटी हैं। इनमें बहिर्विवाही वर्ग "/अदनाम/" (गोत्र) के रूप में विभाजित हैं। इनके प्रमुख गोत्रों में अदनाम बंसाले, डुकरे, देवकर, फाफरे, गोहद, खैरकर, खडके, मागरे, मटकारी, नाटक, परधी, सुरवकर, ताडचे, थोते, उमरे, वाघमारे, ओघम, देशमुखी, धनवे, भैभारे, गायकवाड़, भेदकाल आदि शामिल हैं। गर्भावस्था के दौरान प्रसव स्थानीय "/दाई/" द्वारा घर पर कराया जाता है। जन्म के पाँचवें दिन "/पंचमी/" रस्म होती है। नामकरण और अन्य धार्मिक अनुष्ठान भी संपन्न होते हैं। विवाह की आयु लड़कों के लिए 16-20 वर्ष और लड़कियों के लिए 12-16 वर्ष मानी जाती है। विवाह में दूल्हे का परिवार नकद, अनाज, दालें और हल्दी के रूप में वधूमूल्य देता है। विधवा, विधुर और तलाकशुदा व्यक्तियों को पुनर्विवाह की अनुमति है। ",
      "मृतक को दफनाया या दाह संस्कार किया जाता है, और रस्में दस दिनों तक चलती हैं। अंतिम संस्कार भोज आयोजित किया जाता है, और "/पुण्यतिथि/" हर वर्ष मनाई जाती है। अंध जनजाति अपनी पारंपरिक जाति पंचायत प्रणाली का पालन करती है, जिसका मुखिया "/मोहतारियन/" कहलाता है। पंचायत विवाह विवाद, वधूमूल्य, तलाक, संपत्ति विभाजन, अनैतिक संबंध और अंतरजातीय विवाह जैसे मामलों पर निर्णय लेती है। ",
      "महाराष्ट्र में अंध जनजाति जन्म, नामकरण, विवाह और त्योहारों से जुड़े विभिन्न अनुष्ठानों का पालन करती है। यह जनजाति मारुति, महादेव, मरी अई, माता, भीमसेन, वाघमाई, खंडोबा, कान्होबा, माई, मुनजा और कृष्ण जैसे देवताओं की पूजा करती है। मुर्गा और बकरी की बलि दी जाती है। इनके मुख्य त्योहारों में आखड़ी, गुड़ी पड़वा, नागपंचमी, पोला, दशहरा, दीवाली, होली और महाशिवरात्रि शामिल हैं। भूत-प्रेत, जादू-टोने और मंत्र-तंत्र में भी विश्वास रखते हैं। ",

    "बैगा जनजाति की उत्पत्ति को लेकर स्पष्ट जानकारी नहीं है। विद्वान जैसे रसेल और ग्रियर्सन ने इसे भुमिया या भुइया जनजाति से संबंधित एक विशिष्ट समूह माना है। एक किंवदंती के अनुसार, जब भगवान ब्रह्मा ने ब्रह्मांड की रचना की, तो उन्होंने एक व्यक्ति को कुल्हाड़ी दी, जो बैगा जनजाति का पूर्वज बना। इसे "नंगा बैगा" कहा गया क्योंकि उस समय कपड़ों का अभाव था। ",
    
    "बैगा लोग स्थानांतरण कृषि (झूम खेती) करते हैं, जिसके कारण उनकी जीवनशैली घुमंतू होती है। उनके घर बांस, लकड़ी और मिट्टी से बने होते हैं और अक्सर पहाड़ियों की ढलानों या कृषि भूमि के पास स्थित होते हैं। बैगा पुरुषों का पहनावा सरल होता है; उनका रंग गहरा होता है और उनकी विशेषताएँ जैसे जटाधारी काले बाल, धनुष-बाण और एक छोटी कुल्हाड़ी उन्हें अलग पहचान देती हैं। महिलाएँ विभिन्न प्रकार के लुगड़े पहनती हैं और टैटू को एक महत्वपूर्ण आभूषण मानती हैं। ",

    "बैगा जनजाति की समृद्ध सांस्कृतिक पृष्ठभूमि उनके पहनावे, नृत्यों और अनुष्ठानों में झलकती है, जो मध्य प्रदेश के जनजातीय जीवन के अनूठे और विविध पहलुओं को प्रदर्शित करती है। यह समुदाय अपनी मेहनतकश प्रकृति के लिए जाना जाता है। उनके मनोरंजन में नृत्य और गायन शामिल हैं, और पारंपरिक नृत्यों जैसे कर्मा, लहकी, रीना और सैला का आयोजन होता है। बैगा लोग भूत-प्रेत और जादू-टोने में विश्वास रखते हैं, और उनके देवताओं के पुजारी और भूत भगाने वाले के रूप में भुमका की महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका होती है। ",
