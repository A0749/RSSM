                When Raja Shankar Shah and his son Kunwar Raghunath Shah were imprisoned, unrest broke out among the soldiers of the 52nd Regiment, who attempted to rescue them. This act of defiance alarmed the British authorities, who feared that such a brutal execution could demoralize the regiment and provoke further rebellion.

                To address this concern, the commanding officer, Colonel Jamieson, along with other officials, swiftly engaged with the soldiers, attempting to quell their doubts, anger, and agitation. They sought to justify the harsh punishment, hoping to maintain the soldiers’ loyalty and prevent dissent.

                However, on the night of September 18, at 9 PM, the soldiers of the 52nd Regiment silently abandoned their camp, taking their weapons with them. Leaving behind ten of their comrades to avoid suspicion, the regiment moved as one, covering approximately twenty miles without halting. Their destination was Patan tehsil, with Delhi as their ultimate goal, where they aimed to join the broader anti-British uprising.

                In Patan, a company of their own regiment, commanded by Lieutenant MacGregor, was stationed. Unaware of the rebellion, MacGregor was captured by the rebel soldiers. The insurgents sent a formal letter to Colonel Jamieson, demanding the release of their ten comrades in Jabalpur in exchange for MacGregor’s freedom. Jamieson refused the offer. In retaliation, the rebels executed Lieutenant MacGregor after being attacked by the 33rd Madras Native Infantry.

                Meanwhile, measures to suppress the 52nd Regiment’s rebellion were already underway. A British force from Damoh, approximately sixty-five miles northwest of Jabalpur, was mobilized to confront the rebels. This force consisted of 400 soldiers from the 33rd Madras Native Infantry, a rifle company from the First Madras Native Infantry, a detachment of the Fourth Madras Light Cavalry, and four artillery guns manned by European gunners.

                On the night of September 25, the British forces encamped near Sangrampur, about twenty-five miles from their destination. A reconnaissance team, including the Grenadier Company of the 33rd Madras Native Infantry under Lieutenant Watson and soldiers of the Fourth Madras Light Infantry under Major Jenkins, was dispatched at 2 AM to scout the crossing of the Hirna River near Katangi.

                On the morning of September 26, as the army approached Katangi, they were ambushed by the rebels of the 52nd Regiment. A fierce battle ensued, resulting in heavy losses for the rebels, with approximately 125 killed and many more wounded. Despite this setback, the remaining 530 soldiers regrouped and fortified themselves in Garhakota, a stronghold about thirty miles from Sagar.

                Realizing the scattered and understaffed state of the British forces, the rebels grew bolder, launching further attacks to destabilize the British hold on the region. Numerous skirmishes followed, but no decisive outcome was achieved until early November 1857. Near Jabalpur, in a final and decisive battle, the Madras Infantry defeated the rebel soldiers of the 52nd Regiment.

                Though the British declared the rebellion suppressed, the uprising of the 52nd Regiment left a lasting legacy. Their courageous stand became a symbol of resistance, unity, and equality, inspiring national sentiment among the people of the region.
